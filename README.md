-------------------------------

**Abstract:** This proof of concept introduces an AI-powered, self-contained knowledge base designed to craft personalized historical timelines by integrating personal documents—such as letters, postal mail, stamp collections, card collections, old photographs, and other personal artifacts—into a broader global historical context. By embedding these unique items into a unified vector database, the system weaves a detailed, chronological narrative that aligns personal milestones with significant global events. This approach not only preserves personal history but also enriches it, colouring individual experiences with the broader historical backdrop, allowing users to explore and reflect on the interconnectedness of their past with the world’s history.

Users can query this timeline to gain insights into the context surrounding their personal history, allowing them to explore relationships between personal events and global events, historical movements, or cultural shifts relevant to the time. The AI-powered model provides enriched responses to user prompts, offering background information, historical analysis, and potential insights about the world events that influenced or were contemporaneous with the seeded personal documents. This approach not only preserves individual history but also enhances understanding through the lens of broader historical developments, creating a powerful tool for historical inquiry and personal storytelling.
